========
This repository will hold a project in the future I'm currently working on.  I like to call it "security"
software, but of course you can do with it what you will while abiding by rules.

My project is something I felt like working on from a mere idea that popped into my head one day.  I'm
making some Python scripts that tweet photos taken over a time interval from your webcam.  You can change
the time, Twitter account, preview the picture, and such.  Essentially, this is meant to run on your
Raspberry Pi while you are out.  You can check your Twitter account to see photos of your workplace as
you're not present at home or where ever you have the Pi set up.  I'm using Tweepy and Twython libraries so
I'll include everything you have to do prior to cloning this repo and commiting to it.

GitHub is rather new to me so I'm still figuring things out.  I think I've got an idea of how most things
work about now.  I haven't ever open sourced anything before because everything I've done has been for
closed-source companies.

Hoping to have some essential features out so there can be other people can build upon it if they want!  I'm
just working on this in my spare time or whenever I feel like it.  This could become pretty interesting.
